# NamelessApplications
Refactored versions of the NamelessMC addon [BanAppeal](https://github.com/NamelessMC/Nameless/tree/master/addons/BanAppeal).

## Introduction
I knew there was a StaffApplication module; however, I wanted separate applications for helper and builder on my server.
Accordingly, I took an existing addon, **BanAppeal**, included by default, and refactored it for helper and builder application modules.

## Usage
1. Upload the folders /HelperApp/ and /BuilderApp/ you choose in your /addons/ directory of your NamelessMC forum.
2. Go to AdminCP > Addons > Install Addon > Scan
3. Choose which addons you'd like to use.
4. Configure them by adding questions to the applications.
5. Done!

## Disclaimer
I know very, very, very little PHP. My knowledge is limited to writing an 8-line redirection script.
Please backup your website before using a program edited by someone who doesn't know the language.
I do not assume any responsibility for any problems, issues, or catastrophes that may arise.
I will note that I use these addons on my own NamelessMC website. Nevertheless, I keep constant backups.
