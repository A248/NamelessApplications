# NamelessApplications for NamelessMC v1
Refactored versions of the addon [BanAppeal](https://github.com/NamelessMC/Nameless/tree/master/addons/BanAppeal).

## Introduction
I knew there was a StaffApplication module; however, I wanted separate applications for helper and builder on my server.
Accordingly, I took an existing addon, **BanAppeal**, included by default, and refactored it for helper and builder application modules. Later did I added the player report application using the same approach with the bug report addon.

## Usage
1. Upload the folders /addons/HelperApp/, /addons/BuilderApp/, and /addons/PlayerReport/ to your /addons/ directory of your NamelessMC installation.
2. Go to AdminCP > Addons > Install Addon > Scan
3. Choose which addons you'd like to use.
4. Configure them by adding questions to the applications.
5. Done!

I will note that I use these addons on my own NamelessMC website. Nevertheless, I keep constant backups.
