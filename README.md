# NamelessApplications
Refactored versions of the NamelessMC addon [BanAppeal](https://github.com/NamelessMC/Nameless/tree/master/addons/BanAppeal).

## Introduction
I knew there was a StaffApplication module; however, I wanted separate applications for helper and builder on my server.
Accordingly, I took an existing addon, **BanAppeal**, included by default, and refactored it for helper and builder application modules.

## Installation
1. Upload the files /pages/helperapp.php and /pages/builderapp.php to your /pages/ directory of your NamelessMC server.
2. Upload the files /pages/mod/helperapp.php and /pages/mod/builderapp.php to your server's /pages/mod/ directory.
3. Upload the folders /addons/HelperApp/ and /addons/BuilderApp/ to your corresponding /addons/ directory.
4. Go to AdminCP > Addons > Install Addon > Scan
5. Choose which addons you'd like to use.
6. Configure them by adding questions to the applications.
7. Done!

## Disclaimer
I know very, very, very little PHP. My knowledge is limited to writing an 8-line redirection script.
Please backup your website before using a program edited by someone who doesn't know the language.
I do not assume any responsibility for any problems, issues, or catastrophes that may arise.
I will note that I use these addons on my own NamelessMC website. Nevertheless, I keep constant backups.
