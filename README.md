# NamelessApplications
Refactored versions of the NamelessMC addon [BanAppeal](https://github.com/NamelessMC/Nameless/tree/master/addons/BanAppeal).

## Introduction
I knew there was a StaffApplication module; however, I wanted separate applications for helper and builder on my server.
Accordingly, I took an existing addon, **BanAppeal**, included by default, and refactored it for helper and builder application modules.

## Usage
1. Upload the folders /HelperApp/ and /BuilderApp/ you choose in your /addons/ directory of your NamelessMC forum.
2. Go to AdminCP > Addons > Install Addon > Scan
3. Choose which addons you'd like to use.
4. Configure them by adding questions to the applications.
5. Done!
